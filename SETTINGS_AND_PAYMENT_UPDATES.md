# ✅ Settings & Payment Updates Complete

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Settings Page Cleaned Up

**Removed:**
- ❌ Notifications tab (completely removed from sidebar and content)
- ❌ "Manage Account" button from user profile dropdown
- ❌ Account modal from SideNav with password/username change

**Simplified User Menu:**
```
Profile Avatar ↓
  ├─ Settings (links to /settings)
  └─ Logout
```

### 2. ✅ Password Change Moved to Settings

**Before:** Manage Account modal in SideNav.js
**After:** Settings page → Security tab

**New Security Settings Form:**
- ✅ New Password field
- ✅ Confirm Password field
- ✅ Error/success messages
- ✅ Update button with loading state
- ✅ Proper validation (6+ characters, passwords match)
- ✅ Re-authentication error handling

**Flow:**
```
Settings (in profile dropdown)
  ↓
Click "Security" tab
  ↓
Enter new password
  ↓
Click "Update Password"
```

### 3. ✅ Plan Not Updating After Payment - FIXED

**Problem:** After successful payment, the current plan still showed "Free"

**Root Cause:** 
- The `fetchUserPlan()` function was inside a useEffect that only ran on mount
- After payment verification, the plan wasn't being refetched from Firestore

**Solution:**
- Moved `fetchUserPlan()` outside of useEffect as a separate function
- Now called once on mount AND after successful payment
- Added 1-second delay to allow backend to update Firestore first
- Added logging to track when plan is being refetched

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// BEFORE: Inside useEffect, never called again
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchUserPlan = async () => { ... };
  fetchUserPlan();
}, [user, db]);

// AFTER: Separate function, can be called multiple times
const fetchUserPlan = async () => { ... };

useEffect(() => {
  fetchUserPlan();
}, [user, db]);

// Called again after successful payment
if (result.paymentData.status === "SUCCESS") {
  handleFirebaseUpdate(...);
  setTimeout(() => {
    fetchUserPlan(); // Refetch to update UI
  }, 1000);
}
```
