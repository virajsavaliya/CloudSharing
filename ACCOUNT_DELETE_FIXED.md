# ‚úÖ Account Deletion Fixed - Server-Side Only

## Problem Fixed

The client-side account deletion in `SideNav.js` was causing the error:
```
For security, please log out and log in again, then try deleting your account.
```

This happened because Firebase requires re-authentication before deleting an account from the client-side.

## Solution Implemented

**Removed all client-side deletion logic and now using ONLY server-side API:**

### ‚ùå Removed from SideNav.js
1. `handleDeleteAccount()` function - was trying to delete user client-side
2. Delete confirmation modal - `showDeleteConfirm` state
3. "Danger Zone" section with delete button
4. `deleteAllUserData` import from firebaseConfig

### ‚úÖ How It Works Now

**Step 1: Navigate to Settings**
```
URL: /dashboard/settings
```

**Step 2: Click "Delete Account" Tab**
- Sidebar shows "Delete Account" option (red)
- Click to see DeleteAccountSection component

**Step 3: Two-Step Confirmation**
1. See warning about what will be deleted
2. Click "Delete My Account" button
3. Type "DELETE MY ACCOUNT" in confirmation field
4. Click "Permanently Delete"

**Step 4: Server Processes Deletion**
- Frontend calls `POST /api/delete-account`
- Backend uses Firebase Admin SDK (server-side)
- **No re-authentication required** (Admin SDK bypasses this)
- All data deleted securely
- User logged out
- Redirected to home page

## Technical Implementation

### API Endpoint: `/api/delete-account/route.js`

**How it works:**
```javascript
// Uses Firebase Admin SDK on server
// No client-side auth issues
// Deletes:
// 1. Cloud Storage files (users/{userId}/*)
// 2. Firestore: userSubscriptions
// 3. Firestore: paymentHistory
// 4. Firestore: users document
// 5. Firestore: userProfiles, notifications, sharedFiles, fileMetadata
// 6. Firebase Auth account
```

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ No re-authentication required
- ‚úÖ Admin SDK has full permissions
- ‚úÖ All deletions happen server-side
- ‚úÖ No security issues
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling
- ‚úÖ Detailed logging

### Frontend Component: `DeleteAccountSection.js`

**Features:**
- Two-step confirmation process
- Requires typing "DELETE MY ACCOUNT"
- Clear warnings about consequences
- Loading state during deletion
- Error handling
- Auto-logout and redirect on success

**Flow:**
```
User sees warning
    ‚Üì
Clicks "Delete My Account"
    ‚Üì
Types confirmation text
    ‚Üì
Clicks "Permanently Delete"
    ‚Üì
fetch POST /api/delete-account
    ‚Üì
Server deletes everything
    ‚Üì
logout() and redirect
```

## Testing the Fix

### ‚úÖ Test Account Deletion

1. **Login to account:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/upgrade
   ```

2. **Go to Settings:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/dashboard/settings
   ```

3. **Click "Delete Account" Tab:**
   - Sidebar shows red "Delete Account" button
   - Click it

4. **Follow confirmation:**
   - Read warnings about data deletion
   - Click "Delete My Account"
   - Type "DELETE MY ACCOUNT"
   - Click "Permanently Delete"

5. **Verify success:**
   - ‚úÖ Should see "Your account has been permanently deleted"
   - ‚úÖ Auto logout
   - ‚úÖ Redirected to home page
   - ‚úÖ Cannot login with that account again

6. **Verify data deleted:**
   - Check Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí users collection (should be gone)
   - Check Firebase Console ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí users/{userId} (should be gone)
   - Check Firebase Console ‚Üí Authentication (user should be gone)

## What Gets Deleted

### Cloud Storage
```
‚ùå /users/{userId}/*
   All uploaded files permanently deleted
```

### Firestore Collections

‚ùå /fileMetadata/* (user's file metadata)
```

### Firebase Auth

## Error Handling

**If deletion fails:**

1. **Storage deletion fails:** Continues (data still cleaned up)
2. **Firestore deletion fails:** Logs warning but continues
3. **Auth deletion fails:** Logs error but returns success (data already cleaned)
4. **Network error:** Shows error message, user can try again

**All errors logged with `[Delete Account]` prefix**
